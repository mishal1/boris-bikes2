#Boris Bikes

Week 1 at Makers Academy.

##Context

This was the first project at Maker's Academy. We created a simple system for managing Boris Bikes in London. The system keeps track of a number of docking stations and the bikes. It allows you to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rental. There is also a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.
